<h2>Biography
</h2>
<p>I received a B.E. degree in Navigation Technology (Excellent Engineer Education) and a Ph.D. degree in Traffic Information Engineering and Control from Shanghai Maritime University in 2016 and 2021, respectively, where I was a postdoctoral fellow from November 2021 to October 2023. From September 2019 to September 2020, I was a visiting Ph.D. Student with the Institute for Systems and Robotics, Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal. Currently, I am an associate professor at Merchant Marine College, Shanghai Maritime University. My current interests include localization in marine/ocean/underwater wireless sensor networks and path planning for AUVs/ASVs. As a service to the community, I serves as the editorial board member in Frontiers in Communications and Networks and Discover Oceans, youth editor in the Journal of Ocean University of China, the Ocean Engineering, Journal of Measurement Science and Instrumentation, Complex Engineering Systems, Oceans, Radio Engineering, Electronics and Signal Processing, and Ocean Development and Management.</p>
