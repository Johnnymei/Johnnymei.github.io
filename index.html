<h2>Biography
</h2>
<p>I received a B.E. degree in Navigation Technology (Excellent Engineer Education) and a Ph.D. degree in Traffic Information Engineering and Control from Shanghai Maritime University (SMU) in 2016 and 2021, respectively, where I was a postdoctoral fellow from November 2021 to Octorber 2023. From September 2019 to September 2020, I was a visiting Ph.D. Student with the Institute for Systems and Robotics, Instituto Superior Tecnico, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal. Currently, I am an associate professor of Merchant Marine College, Shanghai Maritime University. My interests include localization in marine/ocean/underwater wireless sensor networks and path planning for AUVs/ASVs. As a service to the community, I serve as the review editor in Frontiers in Communications and Networks, and also as a reviewer in IEEE TSIPN, IEEE TVT, IEEE CL, IEEE WCL, IEEE SPL, among others. I also served as the technical committee member and session chair in ICCCS’2023 and program committee member in iCaMaL’2023 and ICPRE’2023.</p>
